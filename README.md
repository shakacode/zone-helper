Open this up in xCode and push to your device.

Old project name is MauiPomodoro, so there might be a few references to that.

I use this app every day!

## Options and Ideas:

1. Might open source this
2. Might convert to React Native
3. Would like to push to App store and give for free
4. Eventually, we could sell a team based version and charge a subscription.
5. Let's create some issues on what to change.
